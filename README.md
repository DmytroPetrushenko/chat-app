# chat-app

##TASK
How the chat works: when loading a chat, the user enters a name under which his messages will be visible to other users.
After that, the user sees 50 previous messages, and he gets the opportunity to send messages to the chat. When a message 
is sent, it must be stored in the database. Users should have a 'Refresh' button to refresh the list of posts.
